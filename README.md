My sonic game I created with phaser!
Commands to start the game:
- npm install 
- npm run build 
- npm run dev

Then ctrl --> click (command --> click on mac) on the link once it loads

Move - Arrow keys
Jump - spacebar
Spindash - Arrow key down -> spacebar

To refresh rings after all have been collected, press the keys: (Arrow key up --> arrow key down) at the same time

It takes a while to load so please wait
